Description:
		A basic admin scaffold generator for Spree
    Creates a CRUD interface for whatever you want using the Spree admin styling
		It also creates an initializer that insert an admin menu item for the model you created

Example:
    rails generate solidus:scaffold ModelName attribute_1:type_1 attribute_2:type_2

	    app/controllers/admin/class_names_controller.rb
	    app/views/admin/class_names/index.html.erb
	    app/views/admin/class_names/new.html.erb
	    app/views/admin/class_names/edit.html.erb
	    app/views/admin/class_names/_form.html.erb
	    db/migrate/TIMESTAMP_create_class_names.rb
	    config/locales/en_class_names.yml
